# Data Visualization - Assignment 3

## Rami Bassil, Hiloni Sheth

### Goals for second visualization
In assignment 2, we explored a pollution dataset for cities in the Pittsburgh area. For this assignment, we are more interested in the growth of pollution over time in each city, in comparison to the population growth. The main question we are trying to answer is the below:
Are pollution and population directly correlated?

With that, we are hoping to help climate change advocates prove that overpopulation in certain areas can greatly affect pollution. Our assumption is that this is especially true  in manufacturing areas (such as the Pittsburgh area), where energy is mainly produced from fossil fuels. 

To that end, we are planning on creating a Bubble Plot, similar to the one shown in class. We will show each city as a bubble, its population in size and plot them against US AQI and PM2.5. We will also try to add a scale to change years. 


### Overview of development process

Since neither of us have much coding experience and none in JavaScript/D3, we leveraged online resources to work on Part 1. In total, part 1 took us around 60 hours to complete. Most of the time was spent debugging code found online and getting help from other resources (TAs and knowledgeable friends). 

We first tried hard to complete part 1 using node.js and the professor's code template. First, we tested the template code by tweaking it and seeing how it changed. We individually worked on this testing phase and regularly reported our findings to each other. After getting stuck for way too long on several bugs, we ended up changing our strategy.

We found some code online that did not leveraged html and javascript (and not node.js) - while this meant we had to start from scratch, it allowed us to not feel restricted with the existing code.

It is important to note that we are MS in Product Management students and are mainly focused in learning about storytelling through data. This is a critical skill in our field as we will be working with data to create user narratives (while not coding ourselves).
